# The game
There are three game modes:
- Multiplayer
- Easy AI
- Impossible AI
*Note: there is no use of AI in this project. The solution is hard-coded, but saying "AI" looked better nowadays!*

### Easy AI 
Easy AI is built so that your computer will pick a random move without any algorithm behind. Thus, it will be beatable most of the times.

### Impossible AI 
Impossible(it should really be impossible to beat!) is built using a hard coded solution that explores in order of priority the next best move. The priorities are shown as follows:
*If you want to play the game, don't look at it! (You won't be able to win anyways though!)*
In order of priority, the AI will (if possible):
1. Win vertically
2. Win horizontally
3. Win obliquely
4. Block vertically
5. Block horizontally
6. Block obliquely
7. Pick the center
8. Create a fork
9. Pick a corner
10. Do a random move

If you happen to beat impossible AI, please take a screenshot of how you cheated and submit it (along with a brief explanation) using [this form](https://bit.ly/3O72Rpa).
